title: "MH-PCTpro: A Machine learning model for rapid prediction of
Pressure-Composition-Temperature (PCT) isotherms"

excerpt: "The Pressure-Composition-
Temperature (PCT) analysis is an experimental procedure employed to assess the suitability of
an alloy for hydrogen storage. PCT isotherms provide crucial information, like reversible storage
capacity, hydrogen pressure for phase transition, and the plateau pressure. Unfortunately,
PCT analysis of the materials is resource-intensive and time-consuming as it involves series of
measurements to represents the relationship between hydrogen pressure, concentration and
temperature of a sample at equilibrium. Hence, limiting the number of compositions that can
be investigated. In light of this, we have built a machine learning model, Metal Hydride's PCT isotherm
predictior (MH-PCTpro) for multicomponent metal alloys. The model is trained on diverse family of
metal alloyâ€™s PCTs data and the feature set includes easily calculable elements' periodic table
properties, hydriding properties, and experimental parameters. The comprehensive feature set
equips PCTpro to predict the PCT isotherms for any metal alloy based on its composition,
hydrogen pressure, and temperature. The model is validated across diverse alloy families,
agreeing with experimental results. The model also predicts temperature-dependent variations
in plateau pressure, enabling the mapping of predicted PCTs onto Van't Hoff plots to determine
enthalpy and entropy of hydride formation. <br/><img src='/images/GraphicalAbstract.jpg'>"
