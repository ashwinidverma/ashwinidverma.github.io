title: "Solid state hydrogen storage: Decoding the path through machine learning"
excerpt: "In this work we have developed HEART (HydrogEn storAge propeRty predicTor), a machine learning framework to discover new metal alloys for efficient hydrogen storage. Our framework includes two ML models that predict the HYdrogen Storage capaciTy as function of temperature (HYST) and the enTHalpy of hydride fORmation (THOR) of multi-component metal alloys. These models helps us to explore millions of possibilities and identify promising materials for hydrogen storage, accelerating the path towards a sustainable future.
